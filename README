TESTING

This module requires the following modules for thorough testing:

    Test::More
    Test::Pod
    Test::Pod::Coverage

It can also make use of Devel::Cover if available.

UNINSTALLATION

This is a pure-Perl module. The following one-liner should print
out the canonical path of the file:

  perl -MHTML::Rainbow -le 'print $INC{"HTML/Rainbow.pm"}'

Just delete this file. There is also the question of the man page.
Finding that is left as an exercise to the reader.
